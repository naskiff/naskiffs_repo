== Motivation ==
My motivations for wanting to DMing are...
1) Spending time with friends in SL
2) I like taking and organizing notes, have been developing that slowly in the past 3 years
3) I like to see others thrive or have a good time, especially if I had a role in it
4) I like to entertain and make up stories
5) I like to be thrust into random, short roleplay situations
6) I think that narrated combat can potentially make everyone have a great time!
7) It seems like a fun skill to learn, possibly useful. Improv, general things, storytelling.
