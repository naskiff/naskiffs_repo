# Straight movement shapes
Nobi | 1-space jump | 2-space jump | 3-space jump

The further you go, the more flexibility you have but the less strong it is.  Any further than this would not really count as moving from one point to another...

Judging the "speed" at which you should move in all situations comes with experience, but a simple way to look at it, is that the faster you go, the more trouble you are asking for.
<span style="color: #009dff">Also, the nobi is rarely wrong.</span>

Diagonal | knight | large knight

If you want to do something further away than a large knight, it's probably wrong.

The diagonal cannot be separated, because if white takes one of the cutting points, black takes the other and remains fully connected.
White could have tried to start cutting from the bottom right, but black would have answered with the top left.
So if white takes A, black takes B and vice versa.
That is what we call <span style="color: #009dff">miai</span>.

But the <span style="color: #009dff">knight, can be cut</span>!  White approaches in the upper left, black tries to connect, and white can cut right through, and now black is split in two different groups.

<span style="color: #009dff">This is fine</span> though, but this means: You play the knight move when you don't mind the possibility of getting cut.  If you think it's important to not get cut, you should play the diagonal move instead.

The <span style="color: #009dff">tiger's mouth shape</span> is a strong and common shape, but not used for movement.  It's used to defend the space surrounded by the 3 stones.  If white played there, the stone would be in atari immediately, and black could capture it.

Example of a tiger shape being formed <span style="color: #06d001">naturally</span> by white in a real game.
The uppermost stone is the one that white played last, forming the tiger's mouth, to prevent getting cut and remain strong in this general area.
